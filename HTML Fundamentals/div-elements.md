# What are Div Elements and When Should You Use Them?

1. **Introduction to the `<div>` element:**
   - A `<div>` is a versatile entity that can be anything you want it to be.

2. **Styling a `<div>` using CSS:**
   - A `<div>` can have a height, width, and background color applied using CSS (styling).

3. **Using `<div>` without styling:**
   - A `<div>` can group elements together, even without styling.

4. **Example of `<div>` usage:**
   - A `<div>` can hold other elements like a heading and a paragraph, grouping them together.

5. **Alternatives to `<div>` for grouping:**
   - The `<section>` element is often a better choice because it has semantic meaning.

6. **Importance of semantics in HTML:**
   - Semantics refer to the meaning of words or phrases in a language. 
   - HTML elements have semantic meaning, and the `<section>` element is treated as a section by browsers.

7. **Limitations of the `<div>` element:**
   - The `<div>` does not have semantic meaning, making it less descriptive for browsers.
