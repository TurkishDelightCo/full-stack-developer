# What Is UTF-8 Character Encoding, and Why Is It Needed?

**UTF-8** (Unicode Transformation Format - 8) is a standardized character encoding widely used on the web.  

Character encoding is the method computers use to store characters as data. Essentially, all text on a web page is a sequence of characters stored as one or more bytes. In computing, a byte is a unit of data consisting of eight bits (binary digits).  

UTF-8 supports every character in the **Unicode character set**, including characters and symbols from all writing systems, languages, and even technical symbols.  

By setting the character encoding to **UTF-8**, you ensure that every character is displayed correctly on the page. This is especially important for multilingual websites and applications.  

For each new project you create, you should include the following `<meta>` element with the `charset` attribute set to UTF-8 to ensure proper encoding:  
```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```
