# What Are the Different Types of Image Licenses, and How Do They Work?

Images are considered intellectual property, which means they are protected by copyright laws. By default, most images are released under an "all rights reserved" status, where the creator or publisher retains full copyright. This generally prohibits using the images on your website unless you do one of the following:

1. **Obtain Written Permission**: Get explicit consent from the copyright holder.
2. **Purchase a License**: Acquire a license that grants you specific usage rights.
3. **Rely on Fair Use**: Use the image in a way that qualifies as "fair use."

**Fair use** can be tricky to navigate. It typically requires that your use of the image is both **limited** and **transformative**. Examples of fair use include:

- Commenting on or reviewing the image or artwork.
- Creating a parody based on the image.

Some images are released under **permissive licenses**, such as **Creative Commons licenses** or the **BSD license** (used by platforms like FreeCodeCamp). These licenses allow broader use of the images, often with certain conditions. For instance, you might need to:

- Attribute the creator.
- Keep your derivative work open source.
- Avoid modifying the image without permission.

Other images may fall into the **public domain**, meaning they have no copyright restrictions and can be freely used without limitations. Images licensed under **Creative Commons Zero (CC0)** are examples of public domain content.

To find images with specific licenses, many search engines allow you to filter results based on usage rights. Additionally, websites like **Pixabay** and **Unsplash** offer high-quality, royalty-free images for personal and commercial use.

When using any image, always review its copyright and licensing terms to ensure compliance and respect for intellectual property rights.
