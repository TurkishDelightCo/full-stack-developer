# What Are the Different Target Attribute Types, and How Do They Work?

ou may have encountered the `target` attribute on anchor (`<a>`) elements or links. This important attribute specifies where the browser should open the URL associated with the anchor element. There are several possible values for this attribute, each serving a unique purpose. Note that each value is preceded by an underscore (`_`).

1. **`_self`** (Default Value)  
    This is the default value if no `target` attribute is specified. It opens the link in the current browsing context, which is typically the current tab or window.
    
2. **`_blank`**  
    This value opens the link in a new browsing context. In most cases, this means a new tab, but some users may have configured their browsers to open links in a new window instead.
    
3. **`_parent`**  
    This value opens the link in the parent of the current browsing context. For instance, if your website contains an iframe, a link with `target="_parent"` inside the iframe will open in the parent page's tab or window, not within the iframe itself.
    
4. **`_top`**  
    This value opens the link in the topmost browsing context, bypassing all nested frames. This ensures the link opens in the full browser tab or window, regardless of how deeply nested the current context is.
    
5. **`_unfenced-top`** (Experimental)  
    This value is used with the experimental Fence Frame API, which is currently in development. At the time of writing, this value is rarely used and may not be relevant for most developers.
    

Choosing the correct `target` value is crucial for controlling where your users navigate. It ensures a better user experience and aligns with your website's design and functionality goals.
