# What Are Attributes, and How Do They Work?
1. **Definition of Attributes**:
   - Attributes are values placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element.
   - They provide additional information or specify how the element should behave.
   - Syntax: `<element attribute="value"></element>`.

2. **Structure of Attributes**:
   - Attributes consist of a name, an equal sign (`=`), and a value enclosed in quotes.
   - The value can be a string or a number, depending on the attribute.

3. **Examples of Common Attributes**:
   - **`href`**:
     - Specifies the URL of a link.
     - Example: `<a href="https://www.example-website.com">Visit our website</a>`.
   - **`src` and `alt`** (used with images):
     - `src`: Specifies the image file to be displayed.
     - `alt`: Provides descriptive text for accessibility.
     - Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful image" />`.

4. **Accessibility Importance**:
   - Attributes like `alt` improve accessibility, ensuring that websites can be used by people with disabilities.

5. **Boolean Attributes**:
   - Boolean attributes modify the state of an element and do not require a value.
   - Example: `<input type="checkbox" checked />` (The `checked` attribute makes the checkbox selected by default).
   - Other common boolean attributes include `disabled`, `readonly`, and `required`.

6. **Importance of Attributes**:
   - Attributes are crucial for customizing the behavior and appearance of HTML elements.
   - Mastering attributes is essential for creating interactive and accessible web content.

7. **Future Learning**:
   - Topics like accessibility, inputs, and other attributes will be covered in more depth in upcoming lectures.
