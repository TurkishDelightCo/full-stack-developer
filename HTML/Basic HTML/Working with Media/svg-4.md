# What Are SVGs, and When Should You Use Them?

To understand SVGs, it helps to first know how images work. Common image formats like **PNG** and **JPEG** are classified as **raster formats**. These are pixel-based, with data tracking the color value of each pixel. A significant drawback of raster images is that they don’t scale well. If you’ve ever tried to enlarge a PNG, you’ve likely noticed that it becomes pixelated or blurry.

**SVG**, which stands for **Scalable Vector Graphic**, is a different type of image format. Unlike raster images, vector graphics use paths and mathematical equations to plot points, lines, and curves. This means an SVG can be resized to any dimension without losing quality.

SVGs have an additional advantage: they store data in **XML format**, which allows you to:

- Use them directly in your code as raw HTML via the `<svg>` element.
- Programmatically modify properties like color, making them highly versatile.

### When Should You Use SVGs?

SVGs are ideal for specific use cases, such as:

1. **Icons**:  
    SVGs are excellent for creating custom bullet points or adding icons to links, such as social media symbols. Many popular libraries, like **Font Awesome**, use SVGs for their icons.
    
2. **Logos**:  
    For webpage logos, SVGs are perfect because they scale seamlessly, ensuring your layout adapts to any responsive design.
    
3. **Illustrations and Graphics**:  
    SVGs work well for graphics with clean lines and shapes, such as charts or simple diagrams.
    

### Experimenting with SVGs

If you have an SVG file saved locally, try opening it with a text editor. You’ll see its XML structure, which you can edit to change attributes like colors or dimensions. This flexibility makes SVGs a powerful tool for web development.
