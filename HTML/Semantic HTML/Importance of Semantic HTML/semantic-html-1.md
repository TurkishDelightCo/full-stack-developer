# Why Should You Care About Semantic HTML?

**Semantic HTML** refers to the meaning of words or phrases in a language applied to HTML. In HTML, elements have their own semantic meaning, which conveys specific information about their purpose. You can think of an HTML document like a text document: much like a text document, it contains headings, images, bold text, and other formatting.

The **semantic meaning** of an element refers to the special information that element conveys. For example, the `<p>` element indicates a paragraph of text. Most elements in HTML have semantic meaning, although some, like the `<div>` element, do not.

#### Why Is Semantic HTML Important?

1. **Accessibility**  
   Proper semantic HTML ensures the best experience for users relying on assistive technologies, such as screen readers. These tools use semantic information to help users navigate and understand the content.

2. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**  
   Semantic HTML can improve your search rankings. Search engines use semantic information to better understand the structure and relevance of your content.

3. **Improved Development Experience**  
   Using correct semantic elements can make your code easier to read and maintain. For example, instead of searching through multiple `<div>` elements to find your navigation bar, you can use the `<nav>` element to locate and edit it directly.
