# What Is HTML, and What Role Does It Play on the Web?
### Main Points:

1. **Definition of HTML**:
   - HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is used to create web pages.
   - It structures and represents webpage content, such as paragraphs, headings, links, images, and videos.

2. **HTML Elements**:
   - Most elements have opening and closing tags that enclose the content.
   - Tags consist of a left angle bracket (`<`), a tag name, and a right angle bracket (`>`). Closing tags include a forward slash (`/`).
   - Example of a paragraph element: `<p>Hello</p>`.

3. **Void Elements**:
   - Void elements do not have closing tags or content.
   - Example: `<img>` for images.
   - Attributes in void elements modify their behavior (e.g., `src` for image source and `alt` for descriptive text).

4. **Attributes**:
   - `src`: Specifies the location of the resource, such as an image.
   - `alt`: Provides descriptive text for accessibility and in cases where the image cannot be displayed.
   - Example: `<img src="example-cat-img-url" alt="Cat sleeping in the grass">`.

5. **HTML's Role in Websites**:
   - HTML alone can create basic web pages with text and images.
   - Modern websites require:
     - **HTML**: Content and structure.
     - **CSS**: Styling and design.
     - **JavaScript**: Interactivity.
   - Analogy: HTML is like the buildingâ€™s structure; CSS is the design, and JavaScript is the utilities (e.g., electricity, water).
